# GTSS Builder

## Overview
GTSS Builder is a web and desktop application designed for configuring and exporting traffic signal system data in a GTFS-like format (GTSS = General Traffic Signal Specification). It enables users to manage agency information, signal locations, phases, and detectors through an intuitive tabbed interface. The core capabilities include exporting all configured data as a downloadable ZIP file containing TXT files, importing data from TXT files, and running as a standalone desktop application. The project streamlines data exchange for government workers and traffic engineers, providing a robust, client-side solution for traffic signal data management without server dependencies.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application follows a client-side architecture optimized for browser-based operation, prioritizing local persistence over server-side interaction.

### Core Technologies:
- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application built with Vite.
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage with a custom service layer and React hooks, enabling complete client-side data persistence.
- **Data Persistence**: Client-side JSON serialization with automatic type conversion.
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling.
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Navigation**: State-based navigation using Zustand store (no URL routing) for perfect static site hosting compatibility.
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state management.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking and serialization.
- **File Processing**: Client-side ZIP generation using browser APIs.

### Design Principles & Features:
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Professional government-friendly design utilizing a navy blue primary color scheme, neutral grays, and compact layouts for efficiency. Features like clickable table rows, optimized spacing, and smaller font sizes enhance usability and data density. Fully responsive design ensures optimal viewing and functionality across all device sizes from mobile phones to desktop displays.
- **Technical Implementations**:
    - **Client-Side Operation**: Complete conversion from server-based APIs to localStorage, making the application fully functional offline without server or database requirements.
    - **State-Based Navigation**: The app uses Zustand state management for navigation instead of URL routing, keeping the URL constant at the root path. This architecture enables perfect static site hosting without requiring server-side routing or rewrite rules. All navigation (signal details, tabs, etc.) happens through state changes, making the app a true single-page application.
    - **Desktop Application**: Electron-based desktop app support allows packaging as downloadable installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The desktop version shares the same codebase as the web app and works completely offline.
    - **Import/Export System**: Comprehensive data exchange system with TXT file export (agency.txt, signals.txt, phases.txt, detectors.txt) and strict validation-based import with replace/merge modes. Movement type encoding/decoding ensures data integrity across import/export cycles.
    - **Signal Details Page**: Comprehensive management page for signals, phases, and detectors with inline editing and map integration.
    - **Visual Phase Editor**: Interactive map-based tool for configuring phases, including click-to-draw directions, rapid multi-phase creation, and automatic bearing calculation.
    - **Bulk Signal Creation**: Feature with a dedicated map interface for efficient creation of multiple signals.
    - **User Workflow Enhancements**: Features like "Duplicate to Left Turn" for phases, automatic phase number mapping, and interactive location editing on maps streamline configuration.
    - **Schema Standardization**: Data models are aligned with exact TXT export requirements for consistent data exchange.
    - **SEO & Social Sharing**: Comprehensive meta tags including Open Graph and Twitter Card support for professional social media previews with custom traffic signal imagery, optimized for search engine visibility.
- **System Design Choices**:
    - **Monorepo Structure**: Frontend, backend (development only), and shared code are co-located for simplified development and type sharing.
    - **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with shared schemas ensures data consistency and reduces errors.
    - **Component Architecture**: Modular UI components utilizing shadcn/ui for consistency and reusability.
    - **Validation Strategy**: Zod schemas are shared between client and (formerly) server for consistent validation logic.
